This is a Matlab implementation of the fancy idea by Polson & Scott that reformulates the traditional binary linear SVM problem into a MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation in a probabilistic generative model, and by use of the technique of data augmentation, makes it possible to do very easy and fast Gibbs sampling for the solution.

Specifically, I implemented the MCMC part, as well as the case under spike-and-slab prior.

The code is already highly optimized for Matlab (not further accelerated by MEX though).
